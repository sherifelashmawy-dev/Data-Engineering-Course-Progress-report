# Exercise 14: Multi-User Training Data System Design

## Objective
Design a complete data system for collecting and analyzing training data from multiple users for scientific purposes, using Polar JSON data format as the source.

## Scope
Design a system that provides:
- **Aggregate statistics** across all users
- **User-specific statistics** for individual analysis
- **Exercise-specific statistics** for detailed workout analysis

## Deliverables
1. **Data Models** (conceptual, logical, physical)
2. **DAG Workflow** - data pipeline architecture
3. **Data Quality Measures** - validation and monitoring

## Data Source
- Format: Polar JSON (from Exercise 10)
- Content: Training sessions with heart rate, GPS routes, exercise metadata
- Scale: Multi-user, long-term collection

## Files
- `database_design.md` - Complete data model design
- `dag_workflow.md` - Data pipeline architecture
- `data_quality_plan.md` - Quality assurance strategy
