# Exercise 12: Titanic Data Profiling

## Objective
Perform comprehensive data profiling on the Titanic dataset to understand passenger demographics, survival patterns, and relationships between variables.

## Data Source
- **File**: titanic.csv
- **Description**: Passenger data from the Titanic disaster
- **Columns**: Survived, Pclass, Name, Sex, Age, Siblings/Spouses Aboard, Parents/Children Aboard, Fare

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Basic Profiling
✅ Dataset overview and statistics  
✅ Missing value analysis  
✅ Data type identification  

### 2. Survival Analysis
✅ Overall survival rate calculation  
✅ Survival by gender analysis  
✅ Survival by passenger class  
✅ Survival by age group  

### 3. Demographic Analysis
✅ Gender distribution  
✅ Age statistics and distribution  
✅ Class distribution  
✅ Family size analysis  

### 4. Fare Analysis
✅ Fare statistics by class  
✅ Fare relationship with survival  
✅ Fare distribution visualization  

### 5. Visualizations
✅ Survival rate charts (pie, bar)  
✅ Demographic distributions  
✅ Age and fare histograms  
✅ Class-based comparisons  

### 6. Profile Report
✅ Comprehensive text report  
✅ Key insights summary  
✅ Statistical export  

## Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

python titanic_profiling.py
```

## Outputs
- `titanic_profile_report.txt` - Comprehensive profile report
